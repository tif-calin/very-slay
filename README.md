Inspiration: [Slay by Sean O' Connor](http://www.windowsgames.co.uk/slay.html)

Goals:

- basically an abstracted version of it with an incredibly detailed config that lets you mess with all the rules
- replay the hex map back after a game much like in Civ 5 post-game timelapse
- play around with different types of AIs
