- [ ] research
  - [ ] [Hexagonal Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)
  - [ ] [Minesweeper - a brief journey from JS/React to Elm](http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/elm_sweeper.html)
  - [ ] Go through the Elm tutorial
- [x] make tech stack decisions:
  - Elm?
    - [elm-sweeper](https://github.com/roSievers/elm-sweeper) (Hexcells clone made in Elm)
    - [awesome-elm-gamedev](https://github.com/rofrol/awesome-elm-gamedev)
    - [elm-games](https://github.com/rofrol/elm-games)
  - JavaScript game engines?
    - [pixijs](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs)
  - Gonna use Elm and try to use `elm-hex-grid` since it uses SVG and seems pretty sweet.
